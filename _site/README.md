### Hi there, I'm Shahul Hameed (Shameed) 👋
**Enterprise Solution Architect | Technical Head | Technology Agnostic Leader**

I am a pragmatic Enterprise Architect with over 18 years of software engineering experience. My core strength lies not just in writing code, but in evolving complex legacy systems into modern, scalable platforms without disrupting business continuity.

Currently, I serve as the Enterprise Solution Architect at SimpleSolve Technologies, where I led the transition of a monolithic P&C insurance core system into a microservices-based ecosystem. While my recent success was built on **.NET Core and Angular**, I define myself as **technology agnostic**. I believe that architecture patterns (Microservices, Event-Driven, DDD) and business requirements should dictate the tech stack, not the other way around.

**What I bring to the table:**

- **Strategic Modernization:** Proven track record of migrating on-premise legacy apps to cloud-native architectures with zero downtime.    
- **Hands-on Leadership:** I bridge the gap between the boardroom and the IDE. I actively code, review architectures, and mentor teams to ensure high engineering standards.    
- **Global Readiness:** Expert in building configurable, multi-tenant platforms that scale across different regions and regulatory environments.    

I am passionate about turning "tribal knowledge" into documented systems and building engineering cultures that value long-term maintainability over short-term fixes.
