excerpt: "How architects can manage complexity using Obsidian, PARA, and structured thinking."

Architects don’t suffer from lack of knowledge — they suffer from **context switching**.

  

### Why Obsidian Works

- Markdown-first

- Local and future-proof

- Links > folders

  

### PARA for Architects

- Projects: active systems

- Areas: responsibilities

- Resources: reference material

- Archives: completed work

  

### Rule I Follow

> If it’s not written, it doesn’t exist.

  

A second brain reduces cognitive load — freeing energy for real decisions.
