Are your notes a graveyard or a factory? 🧠⚰️ vs 🏭

Most developers (myself included) start by treating knowledge storage like a file cabinet. We save articles, bookmarks, and snippets, never to be seen again. That’s not knowledge management; that’s digital hoarding.

I recently switched my entire workflow to 𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻 using the "Second Brain" methodology. Instead of folders, I use 𝗯𝗶𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀. Instead of saving everything, I filter for "atomic ideas."

The result? My notes now talk to each other. A random thought from 3 months ago now connects to a new architectural pattern I'm learning today.

I broke down my exact setup, including the 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄 and 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗱𝗝𝗦 integration, in my latest guide.
