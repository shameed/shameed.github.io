## Post Text

Coding is 20% writing syntax and 80% figuring out *what* to write. 📉

Yet, most AI coding tools focus on that 20%—autocomplete, snippets, refactoring.

I’ve been experimenting with a new way of working called the 𝗔𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄. It’s an 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 approach where the AI acts less like a typewriter and more like a junior engineer.

*   I define the 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 and 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀.
*   The Agent handles the 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵, and 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
*   I review the 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺, not just the lines.

It’s not about replacing engineers; it’s about removing the "gravity" of boilerplate and config so we can fly. 🚀

Curious how it works? I documented the entire philosophy and toolchain.
