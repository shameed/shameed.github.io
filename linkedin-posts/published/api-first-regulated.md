## Post Text

In Fintech and Insurtech, an API isn't just a technical interface. It's a legal contract. 📜⚖️

If you are building in a regulated space (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR), the "Code First" approach is a liability. You can't afford to "move fast and break things" when breaking things means a compliance violation.

We need to shift to 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁.

By defining your OpenAPI spec *before* writing a single line of C# or Java, you unlock:
1.  𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (Frontend doesn't wait for Backend)
2.  𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝘀 (Linting for PII)
3.  𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 (No surprise breaking changes)

I wrote a deep dive on how to implement this architecture pattern specifically for regulated industries.
