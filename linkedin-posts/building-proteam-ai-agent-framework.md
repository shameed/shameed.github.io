Stop talking to your AI like a chatbot. Start leading it like a team. 🤖👔

We've all been there: copy-pasting code into ChatGPT, getting a fix, then realizing it broke three other files because the context was missing.

That's not engineering. That's micro-management.

I wanted to stop treating AI as a typewriter and start treating it as a 𝗝𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺. So I built 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺—an autonomous agent framework.

Instead of one prompted session, I have:
*   A 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱 that manages the kanban board 📋
*   A 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 that writes ADRs 🏛️
*   𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗲𝗻𝗱 & 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸-𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 that code in parallel 💻
*   An 𝗔𝗜 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿 that handles the RAG pipeline 🧠

The result? I supplied a "kickoff document," approved the plan, and the team built a full-stack POC while I got coffee. ☕

It’s built on a 4-phase workflow: 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 → 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 → 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 → 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄.

I open-sourced the entire framework, including the rules and templates.
