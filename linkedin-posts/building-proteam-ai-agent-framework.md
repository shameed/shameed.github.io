Stop talking to your AI like a chatbot. Start leading it like a team. 🤖👔

We've all been there: copy-pasting code into ChatGPT, getting a fix, then realizing it broke three other files because the context was missing.

That's not engineering. That's micro-management.

I wanted to stop treating AI as a typewriter and start treating it as a **Junior Engineering Team**. So I built **ProTeam**—an autonomous agent framework.

Instead of one prompted session, I have:
*   A **Project Lead** that manages the kanban board 📋
*   A **Solution Architect** that writes ADRs 🏛️
*   **Front-end & Back-end Engineers** that code in parallel 💻
*   An **AI Engineer** that handles the RAG pipeline 🧠

The result? I supplied a "kickoff document," approved the plan, and the team built a full-stack POC while I got coffee. ☕

It’s built on a 4-phase workflow: **Discovery → Contracting → Construction → Review**.

I open-sourced the entire framework, including the rules and templates.
