## Post Text

Identity is the new perimeter. 🛡️🔑

For simple apps, Auth0 or Okta are great. But what happens when you need:
*   Complex, custom token claims?
*   Complete data sovereignty?
*   Integration with legacy internal user stores?
*   No per-user monthly fees?

You build your own Identity Provider.

In the .NET ecosystem, 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗜𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁 is the gold standard. It allows you to build a fully standards-compliant OIDC server that *you* control.

It’s not for the faint of heart, but for enterprise architecture, it’s a superpower. I just published a guide on how to architect a custom IdP using OpenIddict.
