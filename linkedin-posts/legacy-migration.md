🚀 **Stop Trying to Rewrite Your Legacy Monolith from Scratch.**

Big-bang rewrites in regulated industries (like Insurance/FinTech) aren't just risky—they're often career-limiting moves. You lose years of hidden business rules, pause feature development for months, and usually end up with a "new" system that's already outdated by launch day.

Instead, embrace the **Strangler Fig Pattern**.

I've just published a deep dive on how to modernize enterprise platforms incrementally without stopping the business.

**Key Takeaways:**
✅ **Don't split by layers**, split by Business Capabilities (DDD).
✅ **Introduce a Proxy early** to handle traffic routing transparently.
✅ **Tackle "Data Gravity"** using the Transactional Outbox Pattern and CDC (Change Data Capture) tools like Debezium.
✅ **Build an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)** to keep your new services clean.

Modernization isn't about code purity; it's a risk-management exercise. Every release should deliver value, not just new tech.
